# Abstract (200 words): This dataset consists of the dataset composed
# by Sjaak van der Velden (1372-2010). The original dataset in Access
# was built for his thesis (defended in 2000) and enlarged in later
# years.

# Time period: 1372-2010

# Geographical coverage: Netherlands.

# Methodologies used for data collection and processing:
# Bibliographical research, research of newspapers, union material.

# Data quality: (i) Central statistical agencies, (ii) Monographs,
# journals, yearbooks.

# Period of collection: 1990-present.

# Data collectors: Sjaak van der Velden.

# Sources: Sjaak van der Velden, Stakingen in Nederland 1830-1995,
# Amsterdam: Stichting Beheer IISG 2000.

# Text: This data collection was carried out within the framework of
# the Global Hub Labour Conflicts (led by Sjaak van der Velden)
# financed by the International Institute of Social History. The
# dataset by Van der Velden was produced when he wrote his thesis in
# 2000, augmented later on and financed by himself. Because he used
# more sources the time series Van der Velden constructed goes further
# back in time than the CBS series and has more information on labour
# conflicts for many years.  The original dataset is in an Access file
# and can be provided on request.
